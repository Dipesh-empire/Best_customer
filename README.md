# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an online retail dataset using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis combined with K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify different customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Online Retail" dataset, which contains transaction data for a UK-based online retail store.

## Methodology

In this project, we performed the following steps:
*   Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
*   Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics and included Quantity for each customer.
*   Scaled the features for clustering.
*   Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
*   Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers.
*   Analyzed the characteristics of each segment and identified the best customers.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   Pandas
*   Numpy
*   Matplotlib
*   Scikit-learn
